Data Visualization in Python

Data visualization is essential for understanding patterns, trends,
and insights in datasets.

Data visualization is an essential step in data analysis because it
helps convert raw data into meaningful data. Python provides
multiple libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.) to create
effective visual representations of data.

Importance of Data Visualization:

- Raw data can be difficult to interpret, but visual representations (like graphs and charts)
  make patterns and trends clearer.

- A scatter plot helps visualize the relationship between age and income.

- Businesses use data-driven decisions by analyzing visual reports.

- Pie charts or bar charts can help in market analysis and resource allocation.

- Large datasets with multiple variables can be hard to analyze using tables or text.

- Heatmaps help visualize correlations between multiple numerical features.

Common Visualization Types, Their Purpose, and Example Libraries:

| Visualization  | Purpose                                | Example Library          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Line Plot      | Shows trends over time                | Matplotlib              |
| Bar Chart      | Compares categories                   | Matplotlib, Seaborn     |
| Histogram      | Shows distribution of numerical data | Seaborn                 |
| Scatter Plot   | Shows relationships between two numerical variables | Seaborn, Plotly |
| Box Plot       | Shows distribution and outliers      | Seaborn                 |
| Heatmap        | Shows correlation between numerical variables | Seaborn          |
| Pie Chart      | Displays category proportions         | Matplotlib              |
| Violin Plot    | Shows density and distribution        | Seaborn                 |
| Interactive Plot | Creates dynamic visualizations       | Plotly                  |
